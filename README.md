# Phoenix TypeScript Code of Conduct

Everyone - attendees, sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and organizers included - is required to agree to and follow this Code of Conduct.

## Straight to the Point

Phoenix TypeScript is dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable, and accessible environment for all of its participants. Inappropriate behavior, remarks, images, or online posts will not be tolerated and there is a zero-tolerance policy for harassment in any form. The use of sexual language and imagery will not be tolerated. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup and barred from communication on Phoenix TypeScript's sites and networks at the discretion of the organizers.

## Need Help?

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, or need to report anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, please contact the organizers: Paul Shannon or Dylan Schiemann.

## What is considered harassing behavior?

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup and its communication networks. Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.

## Reporting

Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place. If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer or volunteer immediately. Our team will be happy to help you contact security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
